Tractography Clustering - Available Metrics
===========================================

This page lists available metrics that can be used by the tractography
clustering framework. For every metric a brief description is provided
explaining: what it does, when it's useful and how to use it. If you are not
familiar with the tractography clustering framework, check this tutorial
:ref:`clustering-framework`.

**Note**:
All examples assume a function `get_streamlines` exists. We defined here a
simple function to do so. It imports the necessary modules and load a small
streamline bundle.

Average of Pointwise Euclidean Metric
=====================================
**What:** Instances of `AveragePointwiseEuclideanMetric` first compute the
pointwise Euclidean distance between two sequences *of same length* then
return the average of those distances. This metric takes as inputs two features
that are sequences containing the same number of elements.

**When:** By default the `QuickBundles` clustering will resample your
streamlines on-the-fly so they have 12 points. If for some reason you want
to avoid this and you made sure all your streamlines have already the same
number of points, you can manually provide an instance of
`AveragePointwiseEuclideanMetric` to `QuickBundles`. Since the default
`Feature` is the `IdentityFeature` the streamlines won't be resampled thus
saving some computational time.

**Note:** Inputs must be sequences of same length.

Sum of Pointwise Euclidean Metric
=================================

pointwise Euclidean distance between two sequences *of same length* then
return the sum of those distances.

**When:** This metric mainly exists because it is used internally by
`AveragePointwiseEuclideanMetric`.

Minimum Average Direct Flip Metric (MDF)
========================================
**What:** It is the metric used in the QuickBundles algorithm [Garyfallidis12]_.
Instances of `MinimumAverageDirectFlipMetric` first compute the
direct distance *d1* by taking the average of the pointwise
Euclidean distances between two sequences *of same length*. Reverse
one of the two sequences and compute the flip distance *d2* using the same
approach as for *d1*. Then, return the minimum between *d1* and *d2*.

**When:** This metric mainly exists because it is used internally by
`AveragePointwiseEuclideanMetric`.

**Note:** Inputs must be sequences of same length.

Cosine Metric
=============
**What:** Instances of `CosineMetric` compute the cosine distance between two
vectors (for more information see the
`wiki page <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity>`_).

**When:** This metric can be useful when you *only* need information about the
orientation of a streamline.

**Note:** Inputs must be vectors (i.e. 1D array).
